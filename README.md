# TypeScript and Promises Exercise
This exercise will test your understanding of promises and async in TypeScript. The only prerequisite is basic knowledge of ES6 and TypeScript. You should aim to complete this exercise within 1 hour.

Getting Started
1. Download the source code.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary npm packages.
3. Run `npm test` to start the Jest test runner in "watch" mode.

> **IMPORTANT:**
>`membership.service.ts` is the only file that needs to change

The tests are found in `membership.service.spec.ts`. Read them carefully and write the code that will satisfy them. You may use the internet and debug the code as you see fit.

#### Good luck!
